# SuperStoreAnalysis
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW:
Superstore is a fictional retail company based in the United States. They specialize in selling furniture, office supplies, and technology products. This summer, they hired me as a Business Intelligence Analyst at their Seattle office. My role is to identify weaknesses and opportunities within their business, and my goal is to help them enhance their business growth and profitability.

Business Questions:
Which states and cities are generating the highest revenue?
Which product category is both the best-selling and the most profitable?
Which product sub-categories and specific products are top performers as well as those that are underperforming?
Are there products that are frequently bought together?
Which customer segment is bringing in the most profit?
What is the most preferred shipping mode among our customers?
How has the company's performance trended over recent months?
 What are the KPIs?

# DATASET
 The original dataset was obtained from the HiCounselor website. It contains 9993 sales transactions that occurred from 2019 to 2022. This dataset encompasses a wide range of information, including order specifics, geographical data, and product-related data. There are no missing values or any irrelevant data types and values. During the inspection process, a duplicate entry was identified and removed for accuracy. For those who are interested in viewing or downloading the refined dataset, it is available in my GitHub repository.

# Sales by Region and state:
The West region boasted the highest revenue, with sales amounting to $725K, followed by the East region with sales of $678K. Within those two regions, California, Washington, and New York were the top states that contributed the most revenue to the company. Therefore, the company should focus on marketing efforts and optimizing inventory in those states to further increase sales.

# Sales vs. Profit by Category and Sub-Category:
The Technology category emerged as the leading performer in both sales and profit. Within this category, the Phones sub-category stood out with impressive sales and profit figures. On the other hand, the Furniture category showcased significant sales but had a notably lower profit margin. Within the Furniture category, the Tables displayed decent sales but operated at a loss. Additionally, both Bookcases and Supplies resulted in a negative profit for the company. These observations raise concerns, suggesting potential issues with the cost structure or pricing strategy, especially for the Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies subcategories.
